Build a complete and playable HTML5 space shooter game using the provided template.

The gameplay should include:

- A player ship that moves using the WASD keys
- Mouse-based directional shooting
- Enemies that spawn from the top of the screen and move downward
- Bullet-enemy collision detection and removal
- A working HUD that shows:
  - Timer (survival time)
  - Coin counter or score
  - Fire rate display
  - Health bar or value
- A functioning "Play" button that transitions from the start menu to the game screen
- A Game Over screen that appears when the player's health reaches zero
- A game loop that starts and runs using requestAnimationFrame

Constraints:

- Do NOT include powerups, turrets, boost mechanics, shields, ammo systems, or any non-essential features
- Avoid all placeholder comments like “rest of code goes here” or “implement logic here”
- Ensure all three output files (index.html, game.js, style.css) are fully populated and runnable as-is in the browser
- Assume that assets like images or audio might be missing, and the game should still run without them

This is a browser-based game. Design for both desktop and mobile compatibility where possible. Focus on the minimum viable game experience that is fun, complete, and responsive.
